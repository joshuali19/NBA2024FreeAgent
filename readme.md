# Predicting NBA 2024 Free Agent Salaries in Python

This project predicts the value of NBA Free Agents in 2024 by a machine learning (ML) model trained on the player's previous year basic and advanced statistics.

## Abstract

NBA Free Agency is one of the most critical periods of the year for many organizations. With all the moving parts during the offseason, deciding on which players to sign and how much to pay them is difficult to identify quickly. The objective of this project answers this conundrum by building a model to streamline the process of deciding an **estimated player salary based on their previous stats, accolades, and contracts.** This model is pipelined into a financial dashboard of each NBA teamâ€™s payroll for the 24-25 season.These two components work in tandem to identify the positions that are lacking for each team, and identify potential free agents who would fit in their 2024-25 payroll situation.

Our **objective** is to build NBA offseason dashboards to be used by GMs to evaluate potential offseason moves and initiatives for their respective teams.
